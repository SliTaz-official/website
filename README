SliTaz Website
================================================================================


The SliTaz website is hand made, using PHP and XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Code 
must follow standards and be validated by the W3C. We have a main index with 
news, feed parser, Tweets and links to all website languages. Since we Tweet 
and blog only in English, we display these only on the main page but website 
news is translated.


New version
-----------
When a new SliTaz version is published the version string must be changed in 
the configuration file config.php as well as the ISO size.


RSS Feed: rss.xml
-----------------
We have one main RSS feed for the website for short news (max 140 char), the
feed is relayed to SliTaz official Twitter account. RSS feed is checked every
half an hour by http://twitterfeed.com/ and lets contributors use the official
SliTaz account. The Twitter account is also sync'd with Facebook so any new 
items will also be on fb.
