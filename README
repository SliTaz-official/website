SliTaz Website
================================================================================


The SliTaz website is hand made, using PHP and XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Code 
must follow standards and be validated by the W3C. We have a main index with 
news, feed parser, Tweets and links to all website languages. Since we Tweet 
and blog only in English, we display these only on the main page but website 
news is translated.


New version
-----------
When a new SliTaz version is published the version string must be changed in 
the configuration file config.php as well as the ISO size.
