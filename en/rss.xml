The SliTaz team is pleased to announce the release of a new cooking
ISO featuring over 2900 packages. All packages have been rebuild using
our new cooking tool, now included in tazwok. It contains Linux Kernel
2.6.37 compiled against glibc 2.13, binutils 2.21 &amp; gcc 4.5.2. The Core
LiveCD includes Midori 0.3.3. Tazpkg is now entirely translated to
french and we are open to additionnal translations. Tazwok have been
entirely rewritten and it's now possible to recook SliTaz from Scratch
using any ISO. This ISO is the first of release candidate serie which
lead us to stable 4.0 release.

A lot of work has been done since last cooking ISO released in november:
more than 2200 changes have been commited to the wok, and several
hundreds to home-build tools. We are proud to announce that SliTaz
community growed a lot theses last month: the last year, has many
changes was commited than in the four previous - it means all SliTaz
history. However, quantity doesn't suffise to make quality. We need you
to help to test this new ISO and report eventual bugs. If you want to,
you are welcome to help to fix known problems before 4.0 release. You
can join members of the crew via our IRC, mailing-list, forums or by
mailing packages maintainers. We hope you will enjoy, as us, this new
			release!

All of the SliTaz team are proud to announce the release of the SliTaz 
GNU/Linux 3.0 operating system. It's simpler, faster, customizable, 
mightier and yet incredibly tiny. The new SliTaz stable version is now 
out after one year of development.

The core desktop provides a fully featured desktop powered by Xorg 7.4, 
Openbox, LXDE components and home made tools. It lets you easily connect
to the Internet to surf the web with the Midori web browser, listen to
music or manage your pictures.

The default core system fits into a 30 MB ISO image and LiveCD flavors 
start at 8 MB. This stable version has been built by a new toolchain
including GCC 4.4.1 and uses the Linux kernel 2.6.30.6. You can read
the full Releases Notes for more information and download a LiveCD image
from the SliTaz mirrors.
