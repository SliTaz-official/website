 SliTaz Cookbook - LiveCD release tasks
 ==============================================================================
 Things to do before publishing a new version.

  * Prepare the distribution tree and list of packages, generate a
    configuration file and then configure with Tazlito
    (tazlito gen-config && tazlito configure).

  * Check the Window manager menus so that all applications are available
    and that the screen is properly configured (/usr/share/images). Note
    that the window manager menu is installed by SliTaz tools.

  * Add the user hacker, with the addhacker script, copy files from addfiles/ 
    and use examples from system tools (slitaz-tools).

  * Check that the SliTaz version specified in /etc/issue message is 
    the same as displayed in the isolinux.msg file and the Tazpkg mirror
    configuration file /var/lib/tazpkg/mirror.

  * Edit the isolinux.msg file to change the date of publication/version
    and check it's in agreement with /etc/issue.

  * Chroot, in case we need to make any changes to rootfs. Note: we can 
    rebuild the system with 'tazlito gen-initso'.

  * Add and check that documents and images are in the root of the CD - ie.
    README, index.html, style.css and the directory of images. All files are
    in the slitaz-tools archive; just copy the addfiles/ and        
    regenerate the ISO.

  * Test, test, and test ...

  * Prepare the website announcement and RSS feeds, update the Handbook
    if needed and change the TODO list on the developers Wiki.
