	<li><strong>31 Dec 2008 - Cooking 20081231 - Wifi and NTFS support</strong><br />
	The SliTaz project is proud to announce a new Cooking version of the 
	LiveCD. It allows you to utilize and test the work done in recent months,
	it contains many new features, bug fixes and several updates. The 
	distribution now includes a tiny control center, easily managed WiFi 
	via Netbox and tazndis, a lighter version of ndiswrapper to use non-free
	Windows network card drivers. Perl is now on the cdrom (with Lua removed).
	WiFi support is also accompanied by support for NTFS partitions, so 
	mplayer had to be dropped from the default packages that make up the 
	heart of the LiveCD. The Tazpkg manager has been greatly improved, it 
	allows the preservation of configuration files, software to be updated 
	according to the construction (build) date on the server, log files to 
	be kept when the packages are actioned, and several fixes have been 
	applied. Also improved are the boot scripts, and the LiveCD tool 
	(Tazlito) is now more coherent. The Cooking repository now contains more
	than 1100 packages thanks to the SliTaz developers. You can 
	<a href="get/#cooking">download</a> this new version from one of the
	official mirrors of the project.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Cooking 20080716 - Web boot and MPlayer</strong><br />
	SliTaz project members are proud to announce the availability of a new
	Cooking version, including many new features and bug fixes. This version 
	provides the boot option <code>web</code> which lets you boot SliTaz 
	from the internet using gPXE from 
	<a href="http://boot.slitaz.org/">boot.slitaz.org</a>. This new 
	unique service offers the possibility to use SliTaz in Live mode 
	(all in RAM), using the Live options to store your data permanently 
	and preconfigure the system. This new Cooking takes an extra 3 Mb so we can provide: 
	a multimedia player with MPlayer, a notes manager with Notecase, 
	a new version of Tazpkg package manager with md5sum support, XFS 
	filesystem support built into the Kernel, a 'man' command and a few 
	updates. This version requires at least 160 Mb to boot and run properly,
	we offer loram <a href="get/flavors.html">flavors</a> for machines with less 
	resources. <a href="get/#cooking">Download SliTaz Cooking ISO</a>.
	</li> 
	<li><strong>26 Jun 2008 - Cooking 20080626 with new Kernel</strong><br />
	Summer time is here and also the new Cooking from the 26 June. A lot
	of work has been done to improve user experience. This Cooking version
	provides a new Kernel (2.6.25.5) with many new built-in drivers and 
	modules, linux package was also split to have a fairly modular Kernel.
	Default user has changed to <code>tux</code> and the new option 
	<code>user=name</code> lets you choose the default user name. Most
	of the Slitaz utils and tools have been improved: tazpkgbox provides
	some new commands for package management and bootfloppybox can be used in
	text mode, Netbox wifi and PPPoE support are now both working well and
	a new function called zeroconf is available. Most packages are up-to-date
	and Firefox 3.0 is part of the 25.2 Mb ISO. Cooking version can be
	<a href="get/#cooking">downloaded</a> from SliTaz mirror. Bugs can
	be reported on SliTaz Bug Tracking System:

	</li>
	<li><strong>18 May 2008 - Cooking 20080518 and LinuxDays.ch</strong><br />
	SliTaz team is proud to announce the availability of a new Cooking
	LiveCD ISO image providing huge changes from the stable release.
	SliTaz now uses Openbox as its default Window Manager, desktop icons let
	you launch your favorite applications and manage files and dbus and hal
	will automatically mount removable media such as USB keys or Hard disks.
	Packages can now be managed through the graphical Packages Manager
	Tazpkgbox and mountbox and netbox are now much more usable and complete.
	The LiveCD now offers: lua, a desktop search engine with searchmonkey,
	system information with Hardinfo, task management with LXTasks and a
	password and clipboard manager. All the major packages have been updated -

	and Firefox 3.0 RC1! You will now find 580 packages on the mirror
	including wireless support for the kernel and the necessary tools 
	for a manual connection or one managed by SliTaz netbox. This new announced

	</li>
	<li><strong>22 Mar 2008 - SliTaz GNU/Linux 1.0 release</strong><br />
	The SliTaz contributors team are proud to announce the publication of SliTaz
	GNU/Linux 1.0. This is the first stable release after 2 years of work. The
	system is distributed as a bootable LiveCD of 24.8 MB providing a fully
	featured desktop environment and a generous selection of multi-use applications.

	Rsync 3.0.0, Gparted 0.3.5 and sound support with Alsa 1.0.16. The distribution
	lets you listen to music, surf the Web, edit a video studio and much more
	with the 448 available packages that can be installed with our own
	package manager Tazpkg. The LiveCD lets you create a custom distro or a LiveUSB
	device in one single command. Security updates are provided by the project and
	popular packages like Firefox will also get upgraded for functionality. You
	can get SliTaz GNU/Linux 1.0 from the Web site
	<a href="get/#stable">download page</a>. Read the

	</li>
	<li><strong>26 Feb 2008 - Updated Cooking ISO (20080225)</strong><br />

	bug fixes and some new features. We added Asunder for audio CD ripping,
	Burnbox to burn ISO images, a new boot option to let you load Kernel modules
	at boot time (<code>modprobe=modules</code>) and the LiveCD now uses Xvesa
	from Xorg 7.2. All the SliTaz tools and utilities have been updated with
	new features. Tazpkg can repack packages from a running system, Tazlito
	can generate a LiveCD distribution flavor with a few commands and Tazwok can
	check for build dependencies when building a package from source. Please
	check <a href="get/#cooking">downloads area</a> to get a copy of SliTaz

	<li><strong>16 Dec 2007 - SliTaz English forum</strong><br />
	The project is proud the announce the availability of an
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/#idx2">English forum</a>
	providing help and support to users speaking English. Since the project
	is French based, we get a lot of feedback and requests from the English
	speaking community that we want to honour. The forum has its own domain
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">forum.slitaz.org</a>. The default
	interface is in French but settings can be changed when you login with your
    account. The crew is also working on the lack of English documentation.
    Help and assistance are greatly welcomed in the project.
    </li>
    <li><strong>06 Dec 2007 - 2 days for a new ISO that boots twice faster!</strong><br />
	2 days for a new ISO that boots twice faster. With the new lzma compression
	boot time has gone down, we worked hard these two days to improve boot speed
	and finally get SliTaz to boot twice as fast. So we uploaded a new LiveCD with a
	new Kernel patch for lzma and a bug fix for boot messages. Some
	tests gave us the LiveCD booting between 20 to 30 seconds on recent PCs
	and between 60 to 80 on older hardware.

    </li>
	<li><strong>04 Dec 2007 - New Cooking with sound support and more options</strong><br />
	SliTaz crew is proud to announce the availability of a new SliTaz Cooking
	release. It's finally not the expected stable release because we decided
    to add some more hardware support on the LiveCD, like sound and PCMCIA
    support. A new roadmap is on the stove and a stable release should be expected
    in March 2008, matching one year of the first SliTaz public release. This will
    also give us time to bring you a rock solid stable version with all these new
    features and more than 240 packages on the mirror. So, this new SliTaz
    release brings you Alsa with its mixer, Alsaplayer, mpg123, Gcolor2,
    pcmciautils, and a new Kernel. SliTaz also provides new options to use at
    boot time and isapnptools for very old hardware like IBM GL300 6272/6282 or
    P133/32M. All this new stuff fits in an ISO image of 22,4 Mb. The Simple
    Light Incredible... SliTaz (cooking) LiveCD can be obtained
     on SliTaz mirror.  <a href="get/#cooking">Download</a>. Enjoy!</li>
    <li><strong>06 Nov 2007 - Last Cooking before 1.0</strong><br />
    SliTaz project is proud to announce the last cooking version before stable
    release. This new version provides PHP 5.2.5, Grsync, ISO Master 1.2,
    Busybox 1.7.2 and much more in a ISO image of 24,7 MB. We also prepared a
    new theme and wallpaper for JWM and installed a Tango icon.
