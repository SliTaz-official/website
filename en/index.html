	The SliTaz project are proud to announce the release of the new stable 
	version of the distribution - SliTaz GNU/Linux 2.0. This new version is the 
	result of one year of community work and provides an ultra lightweight, fast, 
	scalable and stable operating system. SliTaz provides a complete graphical 
	desktop in less than 30MB, applications required for a reliable and robust
	server environment and 1400 easily installable software packages in a few
	clicks of the mouse. This new version offers the automounting of partitions
	(NTFS compliant), wifi support, an office respecting the Freedesktop.org 
	standards (drag and drop), network booting with gPXE and 
	<a href="http://boot.slitaz.org/">boot.slitaz.org</a>, automatic detection
	of USB and PCI devices, a GUI package manager and control center, and various
	graphical tools to manage the distribution. The creation of USB media and
	bootable LiveCD flavors is also simplified and greatly improved. The core
	LiveCD includes Firefox 3.0.8, gFTP, LostIRC, ePDFView, mtPaint, Transmission,
	Osmo and Alsaplayer. The website documentation has been updated and you can read the

	<li><strong>27 March 2009 - Labs and new mirrors</strong><br />
	Continually seeking to improve the distribution and the services we offer, 
	we are proud to announce the launch of <a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/">SliTaz Labs</a>. 
	This platform makes it possible for contributors to collaborate more 
	effectively, report bugs or request new features. The Labs provide each 
	<a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/projects">project</a> with a wiki, a 
	bug/issues tracker, <a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/news">news</a>, etc. 
	The laboratories provide an overview of activity on the project and 
	track the release of regular updates. Register to participate and 
	leave a comment. The project is also proud to announce 2 new mirrors: 
	In Switzerland, hosted by <a href="http://mirror.switch.ch/">SWITCHmirror</a>
	(10 Gbits/s) and hosted in China by <a href="http://www.lupaworld.com">LupaWorld</a>, 
	thanks for supporting us.

	The stand will be hosted by 3 members of the team during the 3 day 
	event and several other contributors will be present at some point. 
	There you will have the opportunity to test various machines, EeePC 
	for example, create a USB key (bring one with you) or to buy USB keys 
	or bootable LiveCDs. You can also learn about the project and make 
	contact with members of the association and the development team.

	<li><strong>28 Feb 2009 - New Cooking 20090228</strong><br />
	Getting ready for the next stable release! - The SliTaz project is proud
	to publish a new Cooking version with a lot of bug fixes, updates, improvements
	and new features. PCI/USB device auto-detection is now handled by Tazhw and
	firmware can be installed in one click through a graphical interface.
	Tazndis also has a simple GUI which lets you manage Windows drivers in a
	user friendly interface. The graphical packages manager is also much simpler
	to use and LiveUSB media such as a USB key can easily be created through a box.
	Netbox displays all interfaces and the new Wifibox can connect to
	wireless essids, manage favorite networks and configure card drivers
	manually or through Tazhw. The desktop has a GUI to enable or disable
	applications started with an Openbox session and Ivman with desktopkbox 
	provides a lightweight notification system. You can 
	<a href="get/#cooking">download</a> this new ISO image from one of the

	<li><strong>31 Dec 2008 - Cooking 20081231 - Wifi and NTFS support</strong><br />
	The SliTaz project is proud to announce a new Cooking version of the 
	LiveCD. It allows you to utilize and test the work done in recent months,

	distribution now includes a tiny control center, easily managed WiFi 
	via Netbox and tazndis, a lighter version of ndiswrapper to use non-free
	Windows network card drivers. Perl is now on the cdrom (with Lua removed).
	WiFi support is also accompanied by support for NTFS partitions, so 
	mplayer had to be dropped from the default packages that make up the 
	heart of the LiveCD. The Tazpkg manager has been greatly improved, it 
	allows the preservation of configuration files, software to be updated 
	according to the construction (build) date on the server, log files to 
	be kept when the packages are actioned, and several fixes have been

	official mirrors of the project.

	provides the boot option <code>web</code> which lets you boot SliTaz 
	from the internet using gPXE from

	unique service offers the possibility to use SliTaz in Live mode 
	(all in RAM), using the Live options to store your data permanently 
	and preconfigure the system. This new Cooking takes an extra 3 Mb so we can provide: 
	a multimedia player with MPlayer, a notes manager with Notecase, 
	a new version of Tazpkg package manager with md5sum support, XFS 
	filesystem support built into the Kernel, a 'man' command and a few 
	updates. This version requires at least 160 Mb to boot and run properly,

	<li><strong>16 Dec 2007 - SliTaz English forum</strong><br />
	The project is proud the announce the availability of an
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/#idx2">English forum</a>
	providing help and support to users speaking English. Since the project
	is French based, we get a lot of feedback and requests from the English
	speaking community that we want to honour. The forum has its own domain
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">forum.slitaz.org</a>. The default
	interface is in French but settings can be changed when you login with your
	account. The crew is also working on the lack of English documentation.
	Help and assistance are greatly welcomed in the project.
	</li>
	<li><strong>06 Dec 2007 - 2 days for a new ISO that boots twice faster!</strong><br />
	2 days for a new ISO that boots twice faster. With the new lzma compression
	boot time has gone down, we worked hard these two days to improve boot speed
	and finally get SliTaz to boot twice as fast. So we uploaded a new LiveCD with a
	new Kernel patch for lzma and a bug fix for boot messages. Some
	tests gave us the LiveCD booting between 20 to 30 seconds on recent PCs
	and between 60 to 80 on older hardware.

	</li>
	<li><strong>04 Dec 2007 - New Cooking with sound support and more options</strong><br />
	SliTaz crew is proud to announce the availability of a new SliTaz Cooking
	release. It's finally not the expected stable release because we decided
	to add some more hardware support on the LiveCD, like sound and PCMCIA
	support. A new roadmap is on the stove and a stable release should be expected
	in March 2008, matching one year of the first SliTaz public release. This will
	also give us time to bring you a rock solid stable version with all these new
	features and more than 240 packages on the mirror. So, this new SliTaz
	release brings you Alsa with its mixer, Alsaplayer, mpg123, Gcolor2,
	pcmciautils, and a new Kernel. SliTaz also provides new options to use at
	boot time and isapnptools for very old hardware like IBM GL300 6272/6282 or
	P133/32M. All this new stuff fits in an ISO image of 22,4 Mb. The Simple
	Light Incredible... SliTaz (cooking) LiveCD can be obtained
	on SliTaz mirror.  <a href="get/#cooking">Download</a>. Enjoy!</li>
	<li><strong>06 Nov 2007 - Last Cooking before 1.0</strong><br />

	release. This new version provides PHP 5.2.5, Grsync, ISO Master 1.2,
	Busybox 1.7.2 and much more in a ISO image of 24,7 MB. We also prepared a
	new theme and wallpaper for JWM and installed a Tango icon.
