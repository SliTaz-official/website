	<li><strong>4 November 2009 - New Cooking 20091104</strong>
	<p>SliTaz contributors are proud to announce the availability of a new Cooking
	ISO image based on over 2100 packages available in the SliTaz repository.
	The full system has been rebuilt with a new toolchain using Glibc 2.10.1
	and GCC 4.4.1. This new Cooking uses the Linux kernel 2.6.30.6 with better
	hardware support and more built-in modules. The boot process has been further
	improved and the boot time is now faster than ever. Major packages found on
	the LiveCD such as Firefox have been updated to the current stable version.
	Home-made GUI boxes have been enhanced. Tazpkg packages manager supports new
	features including the conversion of deb/rpm/arch/slackware/ipk packages to
	Slitaz native format. The ISO image includes a new Openbox, GTK and icons
	theme for an elegant and more beautiful desktop. We have also removed
	ePDFview and switched to an online PDF viewer. This ISO image, however,
	is a bit bigger than 30 Mb (31.5) due to a bigger Kernel and many new
	dependencies.</p>
	<p>We would also like to announce that the SliTaz project has a new
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">support forum</a> and a new
	<a href="http://scn.slitaz.org/">community platform</a> where
	everyone is welcome to share and to get involved! This new Cooking ISO
	is as always downloadable from the website download section:
	<a href="../get/#cooking">Get SliTaz Cooking</a></p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>19 May 2009 - SliTaz at LinuxDays 2009 (Geneva)</strong>
	<p>
	During the LinuxDays show in Switzerland, the association will have a
	booth in the Association Village and a lecture will be given on Wednesday
	morning. The lecture is a case study with a corporate view based on using a
	"SliTaz Business Server" with a switchboard, integrated ERP, mail, LDAP,
	etc...
	</p>
	<p>
	During the 3 days, the exhibition stand will be manned by members
	of the SliTaz project. The booth will offer demonstrations, including the
	creation of bootable USB keys (LiveUSB) and cdroms. The LinuxDays LiveCD
	will contain a selection of software designed for mobile
	use. The exhibition lounge will also have a forum and we will gladly answer
	any questions. So feel free to visit us! Information can be found on
	<a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/wiki/events/2009-linuxdays">SliTaz Labs</a>
	and the <a href="http://2009.linuxdays.ch/">2009.linuxdays.ch</a> website.

	<li><strong>16 April 2009 - SliTaz GNU/Linux 2.0 release</strong>
	<p>
	The SliTaz project are proud to announce the release of the new stable
	version of the distribution - SliTaz GNU/Linux 2.0. This new version is the
	result of one year of community work and provides an ultra lightweight, fast,
	scalable and stable operating system. SliTaz provides a complete graphical
	desktop in less than 30MB, applications required for a reliable and robust
	server environment and 1400 easily installable software packages in a few
	clicks of the mouse. This new version offers the automounting of partitions
	(NTFS compliant), wifi support, an office respecting the Freedesktop.org
	standards (drag and drop), network booting with gPXE and
	<a href="http://boot.slitaz.org/">boot.slitaz.org</a>, automatic detection
	of USB and PCI devices, a GUI package manager and control center, and various
	graphical tools to manage the distribution. The creation of USB media and
	bootable LiveCD flavors is also simplified and greatly improved. The core
	LiveCD includes Firefox 3.0.8, gFTP, LostIRC, ePDFView, mtPaint, Transmission,
	Osmo and Alsaplayer. The website documentation has been updated and you can read the
	<a href="../doc/releases/2.0/relnotes.en.html">release notes</a> included in
	the distribution for more details on this stable version. SliTaz GNU/Linux
	2.0 is now <a href="../get/index.html">downloadable</a> from the official mirrors of
	the project.
	</p></li>

	<li><strong>27 March 2009 - Labs and new mirrors</strong><br />
	Continually seeking to improve the distribution and the services we offer,
	we are proud to announce the launch of <a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/">SliTaz Labs</a>.
	This platform makes it possible for contributors to collaborate more
	effectively, report bugs or request new features. The Labs provide each
	<a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/projects">project</a> with a wiki, a
	bug/issues tracker, <a href="http://labs.slitaz.org/news">news</a>, etc.
	The laboratories provide an overview of activity on the project and
	track the release of regular updates. Register to participate and
	leave a comment. The project is also proud to announce 2 new mirrors:
	In Switzerland, hosted by <a href="http://mirror.switch.ch/">SWITCHmirror</a>
	(10 Gbits/s) and hosted in China by <a href="http://www.lupaworld.com">LupaWorld</a>,
	thanks for supporting us.
	</li>

	<li><strong>20 March 2009 - SliTaz at Solutionslinux 2009 (Paris)</strong><br />
	The SliTaz project will be present at Solutionslinux 2009 in Paris.
	The stand will be hosted by 3 members of the team during the 3 day
	event and several other contributors will be present at some point.
	There you will have the opportunity to test various machines, EeePC
	for example, create a USB key (bring one with you) or to buy USB keys
	or bootable LiveCDs. You can also learn about the project and make
	contact with members of the association and the development team.

	<li><strong>28 Feb 2009 - New Cooking 20090228</strong><br />
	Getting ready for the next stable release! - The SliTaz project is proud
	to publish a new Cooking version with a lot of bug fixes, updates, improvements
	and new features. PCI/USB device auto-detection is now handled by Tazhw and
	firmware can be installed in one click through a graphical interface.
	Tazndis also has a simple GUI which lets you manage Windows drivers in a
	user friendly interface. The graphical packages manager is also much simpler
	to use and LiveUSB media such as a USB key can easily be created through a box.
	Netbox displays all interfaces and the new Wifibox can connect to
	wireless essids, manage favorite networks and configure card drivers
	manually or through Tazhw. The desktop has a GUI to enable or disable
	applications started with an Openbox session and Ivman with desktopkbox
	provides a lightweight notification system. You can
