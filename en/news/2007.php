		<strong>16 Dec 2007 - SliTaz English forum</strong>
	<p>
	The project is proud the announce the availability of an
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">English forum</a>
	providing help and support to users speaking English. Since the project
	is French based, we get a lot of feedback and requests from the English
	speaking community that we want to honour. The forum has its own domain
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">forum.slitaz.org</a>. The default
	interface is in French but settings can be changed when you login with your
	account. The crew is also working on the lack of English documentation.
	Help and assistance are greatly welcomed in the project.

		<strong>06 Dec 2007 - 2 days for a new ISO that boots twice faster!</strong>
	<p>
	2 days for a new ISO that boots twice faster. With the new lzma compression
	boot time has gone down, we worked hard these two days to improve boot speed
	and finally get SliTaz to boot twice as fast. So we uploaded a new LiveCD with a
	new Kernel patch for lzma and a bug fix for boot messages. Some
	tests gave us the LiveCD booting between 20 to 30 seconds on recent PCs
	and between 60 to 80 on older hardware.

		<strong>04 Dec 2007 - New Cooking with sound support and more options</strong>
	<p>
	SliTaz crew is proud to announce the availability of a new SliTaz Cooking
	release. It's finally not the expected stable release because we decided
	to add some more hardware support on the LiveCD, like sound and PCMCIA
	support. A new roadmap is on the stove and a stable release should be expected
	in March 2008, matching one year of the first SliTaz public release. This will
	also give us time to bring you a rock solid stable version with all these new
	features and more than 240 packages on the mirror. So, this new SliTaz
	release brings you Alsa with its mixer, Alsaplayer, mpg123, Gcolor2,
	pcmciautils, and a new Kernel. SliTaz also provides new options to use at
	boot time and isapnptools for very old hardware like IBM GL300 6272/6282 or
	P133/32M. All this new stuff fits in an ISO image of 22,4 Mb. The Simple
	Light Incredible... SliTaz (cooking) LiveCD can be obtained
	on SliTaz mirror.  <a href="../get/#cooking">Download</a>. Enjoy!</p></li>
